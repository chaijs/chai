# Chai Coding Style Queries

This directory contains lgtm.com queries that help enforce our
[coding style guidelines](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/wiki/Chai-Coding-Style-Guide).

Currently these can only be run manually on the latest version that lgtm.com has
analysed, but they plan to add support for custom queries in PR integration in
the future.
